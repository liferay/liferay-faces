/**
 * <p>This class serves as an alternative to the {@link javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory} that is provided by the JRE
 * and provides the following benefits: 1) The static {@link #newSAXParser()} method does not suffer from the
 * performance problem of obtaining parser implementations from the classpath, and 2) Since {@link #newSAXParser()} can
 * be called without performance concerns, multi-threaded environments (like web applications and portlets) can feel
 * free to call the method as much as required in each request, in order to maintain thread-safety. The drawback is that
 * the {@link SAXParserImpl} class does fully implement all of the functionality of the one provided by the JRE.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more information about the performance issues of the implementation provided by the JRE, see <a
 * href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-perfap2/index.html">Reuse parser instances with the Xerces2 SAX
 * and DOM implementations</a>.</p>
