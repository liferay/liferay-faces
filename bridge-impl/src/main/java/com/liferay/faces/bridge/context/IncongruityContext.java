/**
 * <p>Occasionally there is an incongruity (a mismatch) between the Portlet lifecycle and the JSF lifecycle with regard

 * actions as much as possible.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example: Sometimes the JSF implementation or a JSF {@link ActionListener} will call methods like {@link
 * ExternalContext#setResponseStatus(int)} during the Portlet {@link javax.portlet.PortletRequest#ACTION_PHASE}. In this
 * case, the Portlet lifecycle is working with a {@link javax.portlet.ActionResponse} but there is no corresponding
 * method. Technically the only time such a method could be called would be during the {@link
 * javax.portlet.PortletRequest#RESOURCE_PHASE} because the {@link javax.portlet.ResourceResponse} class has a
 * setReponseStatus(int) method.</p>
