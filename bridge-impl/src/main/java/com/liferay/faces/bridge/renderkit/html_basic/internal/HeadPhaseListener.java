/**

 * navigation-rules in a portlet. When a portal page is first rendered by the portal, all of the portlets on the page
 * participate in the {@link PortletRequest#RENDER_PHASE} of the Portlet lifecycle. During this initial HTTP-GET
 * operation, the bridge has the ability to add JavaScript and CSS resources to the &lt;head&gt; section of the rendered
 * portal page. Subsequent Ajax-initiated execution of the JSF lifecycle via the {@link PortletRequest#RESOURCE_PHASE}
 * are NOT ABLE add resources to the to the &lt;head&gt; section.</p>

	 * developer using code like the following:</p>

	 * new view to be rendered in the {@link PhaseId#RENDER_RESPONSE} phase that is about to follow this {@link
	 * PhaseId#APPLY_REQUEST_VALUES} phase. The list of resources would be contained in the {@link HeadManagedBean}
	 * {@link ViewScoped} instance that is managed by the JSF managed-bean facility. The list would have been populated
	 * initially in the {@link HeadManagedBean} by the {@link HeadRender} during the initial HTTP-GET of the portal
	 * page. The way we "remember" the list is by placing it into the JSF 2 {@link Flash} scope. This scope is used
	 * because it is very short-lived and survives any navigation-rules that might fire, thereby causing the rendering
	 * of a new JSF view.</p>
