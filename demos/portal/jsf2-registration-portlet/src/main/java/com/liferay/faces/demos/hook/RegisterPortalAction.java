/**
 * NOTE -- THIS APPROACH IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN PRODUCTION!
 *
 * <p>This is a portal startup action that will wrap the out-of-the-box Liferay PortalImpl instance with a wrapped
 * (decorated) class. This approach is not recommended in a production environment, because it has an unnecessary
 * performance impact. The reason why this approach is taken here is because it is a convenient way to perform an
 * override with a self-contained portlet WAR demo. Rather than wrapping/decorating, a more performant approach would be
 * to create a Liferay EXT Plugin that simply extends the PortalImpl class and overrides the {@link
 * Portal#getCreateAccountURL(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, com.liferay.portal.theme.ThemeDisplay)} method. The
 * override would need to take place during portal startup by overriding the bean with the ext-spring.xml file. For more
 * information, see {@link
 * http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/development/-/ai/developing-an-ext-plug-4}.</p>
